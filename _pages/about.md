# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Data Mining and Embodied Intelligence, 
School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, 
State Key Laboratory of Advanced Rail Autonomous Operation, China.

My research focuses on **open-vocabulary object detection, continual learning, and prompt-based learning for vision-language models**. I am currently supervised by [Prof. Liping Jing](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8249/) and [Prof. Runqi Wang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/10280/).

My long-term research goal is to develop robust and scalable open-world perception systems that generalize across domains and incremental learning settings. 🤝 If you are interested in my research, feel free to get in touch.

<!-- 📢📢 <span style="color:red;">Our group is seeking research assistants to work on multiple projects related to **Post-quantum Cryptography Chip** and **Encrypted mmWave Sensing**. Drop me an email if you are interested. -->
