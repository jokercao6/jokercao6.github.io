# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Data Mining and Embodied Intelligence, 
School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, 
State Key Laboratory of Advanced Rail Autonomous Operation, China.

My research focuses on **open-vocabulary object detection, continual learning, and prompt-based learning for vision-language models**, under the supervision of [Prof. Liping Jing](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8249/) and [Prof. Runqi Wang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/10280/).

My long-term research goal is to develop robust and scalable open-world perception systems that generalize across domains and incremental learning settings. 🤝 If you are interested in my research, feel free to get in touch.

<!-- 📢📢 <span style="color:red;">Our group is seeking research assistants to work on multiple projects related to **Post-quantum Cryptography Chip** and **Encrypted mmWave Sensing**. Drop me an email if you are interested. -->

  data-abstract="Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) enables models to detect any object category, including unseen ones. Benefiting from large-scale pre-training, existing OVOD methods achieve strong performance on general scenarios (e.g., OV-COCO) but suffer severe drops under substantial domain shifts. This degradation stems from scarce and weak label semantics in domain-specific tasks, and the inability to capture auxiliary semantics beyond coarse-grained category labels. To address these issues, we propose HSA-DINO, a parameter-efficient semantic augmentation framework. We introduce a multi-scale prompt bank to capture hierarchical semantics and enrich text representations from coarse to fine. We further propose a semantic-aware router to dynamically select augmentation strategies at inference, preserving generalization. Experiments on OV-COCO and multiple vertical domains show favorable performance and a strong trade-off between domain adaptability and open-vocabulary generalization."
