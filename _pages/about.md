# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Data Mining and Embodied Intelligence, 
School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, 
State Key Laboratory of Advanced Rail Autonomous Operation, China.

My research focuses on **open-vocabulary object detection, continual learning, and prompt-based learning for vision-language models**, under the supervision of [Prof. Liping Jing](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8249/) and [Prof. Runqi Wang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/10280/).

My long-term research goal is to develop robust and scalable open-world perception systems that generalize across domains and incremental learning settings. 🤝 If you are interested in my research, feel free to get in touch.

  data-abstract="Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) enables models to detect any object category, including unseen ones. Benefiting from large-scale pre-training, existing OVOD methods achieve strong detection performance on general scenarios (e.g., OV-COCO) but suffer severe performance drops when transferred to downstream tasks with substantial domain shifts.
This degradation stems from the scarcity and weak semantics of category labels in domain-specific task, as well as the inability of existing models to capture auxiliary semantics beyond coarse-grained category label.
To address these issues, we propose HSA-DINO, a parameter-efficient semantic augmentation framework for enhancing open-vocabulary object detection. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale prompt bank that leverages image feature pyramids to capture hierarchical semantics and select domain-specific local semantic prompts, progressively enriching textual representations from coarse to fine-grained levels.
Furthermore, we introduce a semantic-aware router that dynamically selects the appropriate semantic augmentation strategy during inference, thereby preventing parameter updates from degrading the generalization ability of the pre-trained OVOD model. We evaluate HSA-DINO on OV-COCO, several vertical domain datasets, and modified benchmark settings.
The results show that HSA-DINO performs favorably against previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving a superior trade-off between domain adaptability and open-vocabulary generalization."
