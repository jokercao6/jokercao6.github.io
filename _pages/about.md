# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Data Mining and Embodied Intelligence, 
School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, 
State Key Laboratory of Advanced Rail Autonomous Operation, China.

I am a member of the research groups led by 
[Prof. Liping Jing](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8249/) (景丽萍) and 
[Prof. Runqi Wang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/10280/) (王润琪).

My current research interests include **open-vocabulary object detection, continual learning, and prompt-based learning for vision-language models**. 
My long-term research goal is to develop robust and scalable open-world perception systems that can generalize across domains and incremental tasks.

<!-- 📢📢 <span style="color:red;">Our group is seeking research assistants to work on multiple projects related to **Post-quantum Cryptography Chip** and **Encrypted mmWave Sensing**. Drop me an email if you are interested. -->
